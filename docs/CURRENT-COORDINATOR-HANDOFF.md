# Current Coordinator Handoff — Wave 15

> GitHub live is the authority. Canonical operational handoff: `docs/WAVE15-MAIN-COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md`.

## Stable Foundation state

- Wave 15 — ACTIVE.
- FND-01 — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
- FND-02 incl. AUTH-04 — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
- FND-08 common timing/WAN contract — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
- FND-03 global — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
- INFRA-CI-01A — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
- FND-04 Script TAG Reference Resolution — VERIFIED/FROZEN.
  - exact product checkpoint: `6c810647c9773a19b212d9c33694780141786ac7`
  - tree: `1221ff55963052be4e924dd644efbaa65763f546`
  - exact post-merge EliteSCADA CI `35913456486` — SUCCESS
  - Web `107358858133`, Backend/test/smoke `107358858405`, Chromium `107359503423` — SUCCESS
  - frozen control commit: `0453428521b28e951aa8e9d01742ee58b09f6690`

## Current active mission

FND-06 is **ACTIVE / NOT INTEGRATED** and is the only remaining FC0-A blocker.

- order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`
- exact product base: `6c810647c9773a19b212d9c33694780141786ac7`
- base tree: `1221ff55963052be4e924dd644efbaa65763f546`
- work branch: `work/w15-fnd-06-visual-stability-foundation`
- target: `wave15/corrections-integration`
- control branch/file: `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FND06-CONTROL.md`
- active control commit: `8d1f415bc16b556e8133e6a1da1ab89881e7f189`
- validation profile: `UI_EDITOR, RUNTIME_RENDERER`

Latest revalidation: work branch is still identical to the exact product base; no FND-06 PR/candidate/handoff exists yet.

Frozen FND-06 scope:
- centralized known-legacy visual compatibility before strict schema consumers;
- Screen/Popup selection stability;
- canonical renderer/public-model single authority;
- selected Screen + Popup-stack persistence across retryable projection failure;
- deliberate reset on real Active identity change;
- Working-design vs Active Runtime authority separation.

Full single-canvas WYSIWYG remains downstream DEV-EDITOR scope.

## FC0-A preparation

FC0-A state: **PREPARED / NOT RELEASED / BLOCKED ON FND-06 + POST-FND06 FOUNDATION AUDIT**.

Prepared release file:
`coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0-A-RELEASE-PREP.md`

Latest prep commit:
`dfae2377f0c6802da726650697040181c7b0f453`

Reserved downstream orders:
- `DEV-EDITOR-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-AUTHORITY-UX-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-LICENSING-UX-FC0A-01`

No downstream work branch is created until Main records the final exact `FC0_A_INTEGRATION_SHA` and tree after FND-06 freeze.

## Later Foundation controls — prepared only

### FND-05

- state: PREPARED / NOT ACTIVE
- reserved order: `FND05-CODEX-HA-AUTHORITY-V1`
- control: `coord/w15-fnd05-control:docs/WAVE15-FND05-CONTROL.md`
- prep commit: `66d0f0e53a9842c719cfe28ef40da3b7fbdd1f6f`

Prepared around one server-owned Cluster/Node/effective-Active/fencing contract, manual break-before-make transfer first, Runtime Session Lease continuity and no client/Driver election.

### FND-07

- state: PREPARED / NOT ACTIVE
- reserved order: `FND07-CODEX-DETACH-NEUTRAL-V1`
- control: `coord/w15-fnd07-control:docs/WAVE15-FND07-CONTROL.md`
- prep commit: `760e1cb57a1bdb1e146a6326bd55f713c7790add`

Prepared around secure populated-install Application+Authority detach, Runtime/process-effect fencing, old-session invalidation, neutral bootstrap, explicit license keep/remove/replace and no silent Historian deletion.

Neither later Foundation is authorized to mutate product while FND-06 owns the sequential high-risk Foundation executor.

## Current guards

- product changes only through isolated branch/PR; no direct feature writes to integration/main;
- exact-SHA evidence and natural Wave 15 T1 required;
- red CI diagnosed before rerun;
- downstream lanes consume frozen Foundation contracts and stop with `BLOCKED-CONTRACT` if a contract change is required;
- no force push/destructive rebase/evidence deletion;
- no Product Owner message relay between agents; agents read GitHub live control/ledger.

Primary ledger: Issue #305.


## FND-06 corrected execution metadata

- active order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`
- validation profile: `UI_EDITOR, RUNTIME_RENDERER`
- known legacy set: `tank | value | dynamo | status`
- `status` is compatibility-only unless a lossless migration is separately proven; no alias guessing
- control commit: `8d1f415bc16b556e8133e6a1da1ab89881e7f189`


## FC0-A collision guard

The prepared downstream release package now includes a Main-owned parallel-file collision map. Primary ownership is separated across Editor (`engineering/visual-editor/**`), Script Engineering (`engineering/scripts/**` + `python-editor/**`), Authority UX (`UserAdministration*`) and Licensing UX (`web/licensing/**` + `Scada.LicenseGenerator/**`). Shared shell/router/types/i18n/CI files are Main-coordinated hotspots, not free-for-all lane ownership.

Latest FC0-A prep commit: `dfae2377f0c6802da726650697040181c7b0f453`.


## Same sequential CODEX routing

The CODEX chat/lane that executed prior Foundation work including FND-04 is the active FND-06 executor.

- FND-04 old control no longer means executor WAIT.
- FND-04 control rev 0016 routes that same CODEX through `ROUTE-SEQUENTIAL-CODEX-TO-FND06-12`.
- routed destination: `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FND06-CONTROL.md`
- active FND-06 order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`
- FND-06 control commit: `8d1f415bc16b556e8133e6a1da1ab89881e7f189`

On `SIGA`, that CODEX should execute FND-06, not report FND-04 frozen/wait.

## FC0-A release gate update

After FND-06 freeze, FC0-A still waits for `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`.

The audit must close the Wave14->Wave15 premise/gap matrix and prove FND-05/FND-07 are non-breaking to frozen contracts consumed by the first four DEVs.

Only after audit `ACCEPTABLE / FC0A_RELEASE_APPROVED` may Main activate:
- DEV-EDITOR;
- DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING;
- DEV-AUTHORITY-UX;
- DEV-LICENSING-UX;
- FND-05;
- FND-07.

FND-05 and FND-07 remain PREPARED / NOT ACTIVE until then.


## FND-06 Main review — mounted legacy closeout

Current PR #337 candidate:
- head `923543705378016090e7067b35954795a9591a57`
- tree `5657cee7169a4e77370d416add4efcf07184d7c0`
- natural T1 `35931139983` — SUCCESS
- 9 changed files, all inside FND-06 allowlist
- architecture/scope accepted by Main.

Remaining gate before merge:
- original Wave 14 A7 was a mounted Screen/Popup selection crash that blanked/poisoned Engineering;
- candidate currently proves model/helper compatibility but lacks the required mounted Screen + Popup persisted-legacy selection regression;
- active order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`;
- control revision `0005`;
- control commit `8d1f415bc16b556e8133e6a1da1ab89881e7f189`;
- preferred delta: tests only; minimal production fix only if the mounted scenario exposes a remaining defect.

The same sequential CODEX lane remains the executor. No merge/freeze yet.


## PR #337 contract-risk snapshot for post-FND06 FC0-A gate

Post-FND06 audit control:
- audit: `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`
- audit rev: `0002`
- latest audit-control commit: `9e75fd836d03dc34619f72ba5056e3aa874cfdbb`

PR #337 pre-freeze evidence:
- candidate `923543705378016090e7067b35954795a9591a57`
- tree `5657cee7169a4e77370d416add4efcf07184d7c0`
- natural T1 `35931139983` SUCCESS
- no Security/Authority/Licensing/Script/lifecycle contract change in its 9-file visual/editor/runtime delta
- FND-06 still HOLD pending mounted A7 closeout; this is an evidence gate, not a known contract break.

Current FC0-A contract-risk classification:
- DEV-EDITOR: `LOW / GUARDED` — must consume frozen FND-06 compatibility/renderer authority; mounted A7 proof still pending.
- DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING: `NONE IDENTIFIED / GUARDED` — FND-04 remains untouched; FND-05 may only fence execution authority around it.
- DEV-AUTHORITY-UX: `NONE IDENTIFIED / GUARDED` — FND-07 must compose FND-02/AUTH-04, not redefine it.
- DEV-LICENSING-UX: `LOW BUT MATERIAL RESIDUAL` — FND-05 redundancy entitlement/readiness must remain additive/backward-compatible to frozen FND-03 semantics.

FND-05 hard guard:
- control rev `0003`
- commit `85502eaaa3a27fc2c050396b3f40c3e08943ae37`
- existing FND-03 license validity/meaning, Interactive/ViewOnly/session quota semantics, machine binding and install/replace/remove behavior may not be reinterpreted by HA.
- if HA needs such a breaking change -> `BLOCKED-CONTRACT` before FC0-A DEV release.

FC0-A release prep snapshot commit:
`c0e4bd69c89c47efc7dc936a6ac9e61cbbbd8f96`.

This is pre-freeze risk assessment only; final release still requires exact FND-06 freeze + independent post-FND06 audit PASS.

Post-FND06 audit remains blocking and is preloaded with this exact checkpoint:
- `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`
- audit rev `0003`
- audit-control commit `a9ed4003acf8c71db035bc854a75f87cf97273fb`
- state `PREPARED / WAIT_FND06_POST_MERGE_CI_GREEN`

No FC0-A DEV, FND-05 or FND-07 release until FND-06 freezes and the independent audit returns `ACCEPTABLE / FC0A_RELEASE_APPROVED`.


## Current blocker — INFRA-CI-01B

FND-06 product work is merged and Main-accepted, but not frozen.

- FND-06 merge: `624f2eca456310a2c6156538b3616a06e3be075f`
- post-merge CI `35940661531`: FAILURE
- failure: PostgreSQL `23505 pg_namespace_nspname_index` during shared-schema initialization
- FND-06 causality: not established; failing source/test blobs unchanged by FND-06
- historical same-signature Wave 14 evidence exists
- no blind rerun authorized.

Active sequential CODEX mission:
- `INFRA-CI-01B-POSTGRES-SCHEMA-LOCK-V2`
- control: `coord/w15-infra-ci-01b-control:docs/WAVE15-INFRA-CI-01B-CONTROL.md`
- control commit: `be7a2d875c24e07d023162e64c65acb0aebe9672`
- work: `work/w15-infra-ci-01b-postgresql-schema-init`
- exact base: `624f2eca456310a2c6156538b3616a06e3be075f`.

FND-06 control rev `0007` routes this same CODEX to INFRA-CI-01B.
FND-04 legacy routing control rev `0019` also routes directly to INFRA-CI-01B.

FC0-A and independent audit are not released until:
1. INFRA-CI-01B correction is reviewed/merged;
2. exact broad integration CI is green;
3. FND-06 is declared VERIFIED/FROZEN;
4. post-FND06 audit returns ACCEPTABLE / FC0A_RELEASE_APPROVED.


## INFRA-CI-01B V2 widened only for shared-schema DDL sequencing

Intermediate PR #338 head `97c665c8e4d62268336dfdef400f992c2f9d43cf` remains unmerged.

Full local concurrency RED exposed additional creators:
- PostgreSqlAuthorityPolicyStore
- PostgreSqlAuthorityLifecycleStore
- PostgreSqlRuntimeSessionLeaseStore

Current order is `INFRA-CI-01B-POSTGRES-SCHEMA-LOCK-V2` at control commit `be7a2d875c24e07d023162e64c65acb0aebe9672`.

Only initialization lock sequencing is authorized in those files. No Authority, session, quota, admission, fencing or licensing semantics may change.


## Current active order — FND-06 E2E fixture isolation

Broad run `35944510920` proved INFRA-CI-01B backend correction green but exposed a test-only FND-06 fixture leak.

Active order:
`FND06-CODEX-E2E-FIXTURE-ISOLATION-V6`

Exact base:
`eb4563cf0060449b479c4335ef30a19ed65e35ab`

Work:
`work/w15-fnd06-e2e-fixture-isolation`

Only authorized mutation:
`web/scada-web/tests-e2e/fnd06-mounted-legacy-selection.spec.ts`

Do not weaken `runtime.spec.ts`, change product code, import semantics, Playwright workers/order/retries or CI workflow.

Required strategy: temporarily update existing canonical Screen/Popup identities, then restore those same identities in finally; prove no fnd06 fixture remains.

INFRA-CI-01B is merged/Main-accepted and requires no further mutation.
FC0-A audit remains PREPARED / blocked.


## Pre-audit finding — W15-P1-01 Server Script recovery

While preparing the mandatory post-FND06 FC0-A audit, Main revalidated the current Server Script runtime against the final Wave 14 backlog contract.

Current source still shows:
- `ScriptRuntimeExecutionCoordinator.ProcessNextAsync` returns `Throttled` while diagnostics `IsThrottled` is true;
- the only coordinator exit is explicit `ResetThrottle()`;
- repository search found no production automatic Server Script caller of `ResetThrottle()`;
- existing tests prove timeout -> throttled behavior, not bounded cooldown/half-open/probe recovery.

Wave 14/W15-P1-01 explicitly required bounded automatic recovery and rejected a permanent silent throttle latch.

Preliminary disposition:
`W15-P1-01 = PRELIMINARY BLOCKED_FOUNDATION`

This finding is independent of FND-06 and does not prevent FND-06 from becoming VERIFIED/FROZEN if exact broad CI #1565 is green. It **does** prevent immediate FC0-A release if the independent audit confirms it.

Audit evidence:
- `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-POST-FND06-AUDIT-EVIDENCE.md`
- preliminary matrix commit `3483faf3aab4940791807b07b4453865629d9077`
- audit control rev 0008 / commit `18a0fcda2b354779cdf0f1ba4d829a838714b3d2`.

DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING may not absorb this runtime/Foundation correction silently.


## Independent AUD routing prepared

The former FND-04 independent AUD lane is now pre-routed, but not activated, for the mandatory post-FND06 closure audit.

- current AUD order: `FC0A-AUD-WAIT-FND06-FINAL-BROAD-0012`
- state: `WAIT_FND06_FINAL_BROAD`
- final broad: `35953557122`
- provisional exact product checkpoint: `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`
- FND-04 AUD control rev 0023 / `1be8ef8cbdd555f3fa554e905faafab186c21dd3`
- next audit: `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`

AUD must independently confirm/disprove Main's preliminary P1-01 Server Script recovery blocker after activation.


## Pre-audit finding — W15-P1-06 truthful Engineering fallback

Exact source inspected at the final FND-06 product checkpoint `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`:

`web/scada-web/src/engineering/EngineeringApp.tsx`

Observed:
- `snapshot` initializes as null while loading;
- failed load sets/keeps `snapshot=null` and renders an error/retry state;
- the sidebar project chip nevertheless renders `snapshot?.workspace.projectName ?? snapshot?.workspace.projectKey ?? 'Demo Project'`;
- therefore an absent/unloaded public model can still be displayed as `Demo Project`;
- no-model WorkspaceBar fallbacks can also present `unsaved` / `clean` despite no authoritative Working model.

This matches the Wave14 A6 / W15-P1-06 class that required truthful loading/unavailable/error identity rather than a fictitious Working project.

Preliminary disposition:
`W15-P1-06 = PRELIMINARY BLOCKED_PRODUCT / SHARED_ENGINEERING_SHELL`

This is not causal to FND-06 and does not block its freeze if broad #1565 is green. If independent audit confirms it, FC0-A remains blocked until a bounded shared-shell correction is integrated/revalidated.

Audit control rev 0009:
`888473cbf27e003d659ec3dd87de2f0f89240474`

Evidence matrix:
`a5260ca309742894ee48e8cce17d9175d67cda08`.


## Audit blocker correction preparation

Coordination-only preparation exists for the two preliminary blockers. It does **not** authorize product mutation:

`coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-AUDIT-BLOCKER-CORRECTION-PREP.md`

prep commit:
`5904924faf7dcc13ec42c495ff54fe6ef82ad005`

Prepared, inactive orders:
- `FC0A-BLOCKER-P101-SERVER-SCRIPT-RECOVERY-V1`
- `FC0A-BLOCKER-P106-ENGINEERING-FALLBACK-V1`

Activation is forbidden until independent audit confirms the corresponding finding on the exact frozen post-FND06 checkpoint.

P1-01 plan preserves FND-04 Script TAG semantics, sandbox isolation, bounded queue/coalescing and Active revision safety while replacing a permanent latch only if confirmed.

P1-06 plan preserves lifecycle/Authority/FND-06 contracts while removing fictitious no-snapshot project/status state and distinguishing transport rejection from actual HTTP response only if confirmed.


## FND-06 final freeze / FC0-A audit active

FND-06 is now **VERIFIED/FROZEN**.

Exact product checkpoint:
- SHA `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`;
- tree `674019fbbc21001a2d68deb853c2c0b293e0a5cb`;
- broad `35953557122` / EliteSCADA CI #1565 — **SUCCESS**;
- Web SUCCESS;
- Backend build/test/smoke SUCCESS;
- Chromium end-to-end SUCCESS.

Main verified that divergence above the product checkpoint was coordination-doc-only before freeze.

FND-06 control:
- rev 0012;
- commit `44c372d8316733398d25f72f3331b12022ab6594`;
- CODEX order `FND06-CODEX-FROZEN-FINAL-08 / NO_MUTATION`.

Mandatory independent post-FND06 audit is now **ACTIVE**:
- audit `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`;
- audit rev 0010 / `72421abee84ac09415a045b7c86d554dba7dd187`;
- AUD lane rev 0024 / `0048a198a2c7d2ac40dd1a055c5bcc6346f30fe8`;
- order `FC0A-AUD-ACTIVE-POST-FND06-0013`.

Main preliminary P1-01 and P1-06 findings remain hypotheses until independent AUD disposition.

No FC0-A DEV, FND-05 or FND-07 release yet.


## Main-owned FC0-A audit result / active P1-01 correction

Audit owner is Main Coordinator.

Final result:
`FC0-A FOUNDATION AUDIT -> MAIN COORDINATOR — CHANGES_REQUIRED`

Audit report:
- `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-POST-FND06-AUDIT-RESULT.md`
- commit `463d357f8a9c11f774f5da59480e4a17a19569f5`.

Confirmed blockers:
1. W15-P1-01 Server Script bounded recovery missing;
2. W15-P1-06 truthful Engineering fallback missing.

FND-05 and FND-07 are contract-compatible under their current hard guards; no breaking contract delta is required now.

Active correction:
- order `FC0A-BLOCKER-P101-SERVER-SCRIPT-RECOVERY-V1`;
- branch `work/w15-fc0a-p101-server-script-recovery`;
- exact base `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`;
- profile `SCRIPT_RUNTIME`;
- control commit `b8858d08a8516588db4be40d2da48ea266fe793e`;
- CODEX routing rev 0026 / `a088c884d90bd0c2d86b844f74332306a80b7a7c`.

Queued after P1-01:
`FC0A-BLOCKER-P106-ENGINEERING-FALLBACK-V1`.

DEV-EDITOR / DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING / DEV-AUTHORITY-UX / DEV-LICENSING-UX / FND-05 / FND-07 remain HOLD.


## Post-FND06 audit — second-pass deep review

Main completed a distinct second-pass audit on the frozen baseline:
`560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3` / tree `674019fbbc21001a2d68deb853c2c0b293e0a5cb`.

Report:
`coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-POST-FND06-AUDIT-SECOND-PASS.md`

report commit:
`43c266949236af377ba859c9b8f09fa2d3a3a31a`

audit control rev 0012:
`62a731cc4291b751e9cb2e91e440fcf0d5ffb3bd`

release-prep refinement:
`c78895b218608b511e61b90206189d2b641a1e71`

Second-pass conclusion:
`NO NEW PRE-FC0A BLOCKER IDENTIFIED`.

The two confirmed release blockers remain:
- W15-P1-01 Server Script bounded recovery;
- W15-P1-06 truthful Engineering no-model/loading/error state.

New/refined downstream findings:
- DEV-EDITOR must consume FND-06 compatibility for known-legacy marquee/geometry/z-order/multi-object authoring paths that still use strict built-in lookup;
- DEV-SCRIPT must make Script Assistant consume the FND-06 compatibility seam for known-legacy property discovery;
- Script Engineering already has cursor-aware insertion and timer/tagChanged authoring, so those are regression/refinement scope, not greenfield;
- Python API Help still lacks a formal signature/parameter/return/example contract;
- DEV-LICENSING must surface requested vs granted Runtime class, explicit ViewOnly request and Interactive-quota fallback/reason UX; backend Authority/capacity contract is already sound;
- one minor Runtime API message still says `viewer` where canonical public vocabulary is `viewOnly`;
- W15-P2-01 Trends still lacks explicit realtime/reconnect/last-request/last-success/freshness observability;
- W15-P2-02 shared Popup/live-value path correctly handles numeric zero/quality but still lacks explicit freshness-age/reason telemetry.

Contract result strengthened:
- FND-05 remains ADDITIVE / COMPATIBLE;
- FND-07 remains COMPOSITIONAL / COMPATIBLE;
- production host uses `EngineeringWorkspace(seedDemo:false)`, so a truthful neutral no-Demo workspace is already representable;
- existing Authority detach/attach/switch primitives further reduce FND-07 contract risk.

No DEV/FND-05/FND-07 release occurs until P1-01 and P1-06 close and Main reruns the affected release rows.


## Main Coordinator takeover — third post-FND06 audit pass (2026-09-24)

Live takeover revalidated against GitHub after coordinator-chat rotation.

- frozen product checkpoint remains `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3` / tree `674019fbbc21001a2d68deb853c2c0b293e0a5cb`;
- post-FND06 FC0-A audit remains `CHANGES_REQUIRED`;

## Main decision — consolidated FC0-A correction package (2026-09-24)

Product Owner requested that all known FC0-A findings be corrected now where safely possible, with one larger CODEX delivery before the next Main review.

Active order:
- `FC0A-CONSOLIDATED-CORRECTION-PACKAGE-V2`
- control: `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-CONSOLIDATED-CORRECTION-PACKAGE.md`
- control commit: `0ab4a2f9226a1f3710aa516dff9534d880023218`
- branch: `work/w15-fc0a-consolidated-corrections`
- exact base: `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`
- exact base tree: `674019fbbc21001a2d68deb853c2c0b293e0a5cb`
- one consolidated PR only after the package is complete and exact-head validation is green.

The former P1-01-only order/branch is superseded unused; it was identical to base with no PR at supersession.

The package includes the two mandatory blockers plus confirmed shared/downstream residuals that can be safely brought forward: shell responsiveness, account keyboard regression, Engineering scroll composition, Engineering Lock density, Trends/live-value freshness observability, contextual Help routing, canonical viewOnly wording, frozen FND-06 compatibility consumption in Editor/Script Assistant, structured Script API Help/representative recipe, Runtime Session/Licensing requested/granted UX, and Template/Equipment/Library inspection.

Evidence-bounded/speculative items and future Foundations remain outside the package. Frozen FND-01/02/03/04/06/08 semantics may not be redefined.

Sequential CODEX route updated to rev 0027 / commit `93d79a773d7571677a9f43e6f3a80ad21aa25612`.
No intermediate Main review is required; CODEX returns one final candidate handoff unless a real contract/base/environment blocker prevents safe completion.


## Main decision — six prepared parallel DEV chats / CODEX as sequential validator (2026-09-24)

Product Owner clarified that the previous `normally no more than four active coding DEVs` rule was a historical operational throttle for a different context and is **not** a permanent Wave 15 concurrency limit.

Prepared post-FC0A implementation chats:
- DEV-EDITOR;
- DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING;
- DEV-AUTHORITY-UX;
- DEV-LICENSING-UX;
- FND-05 DEV;
- FND-07 DEV.

Canonical cross-lane coordination:
- branch: `coord/w15-parallel-dev-control`
- file: `docs/WAVE15-PARALLEL-DEV-CONTROL.md`
- prepared control commit: `87479d0bc3042435935ac1dbaa119d3a7ed72bd6`

All six are **PREPARED / BLOCKED** until Main records `FC0A_RELEASE_APPROVED` on an exact integrated SHA/tree. No work branch is created before that exact activation base is known.

Execution pipeline:
`normal DEV chat implements code -> Main reviews -> same DEV corrects material defects -> Main accepts exact candidate for CODEX -> sequential scarce CODEX writes/extends tests, runs focused/adversarial local validation and exact-head T1 -> Main finalizes integration`.

CODEX may make small validation-driven corrections that do not redesign the feature. Material product/design defects return to the owning DEV. Frozen-contract insufficiency returns to Main.

Feature DEV results stay in **separate PRs**; they are not combined into a raw monolithic implementation package. After individually accepted/T1-green merges, Main runs broader integrated T2 on the exact integration head.

FND-05/FND-07 also move to normal-chat DEV implementation:
- FND-05 prepared order: `FND05-DEV-HA-AUTHORITY-V1`; dedicated control rev 0004 / commit `f3f685cff16ebfef53db4aa69b061d7bac773829`.
- FND-07 prepared order: `FND07-DEV-DETACH-NEUTRAL-V1`; dedicated control rev 0003 / commit `ae92f5f1ec55464eea7f231c178d0a05dc04df13`.

Foundation validation remains stricter:
`DEV -> Main contract review -> CODEX adversarial/focused validation -> exact-head T1 -> Main merge -> post-merge validation -> VERIFIED/FROZEN`.

FND-05 additionally requires `CODEX_HA_ADVERSARIAL_GREEN`.

Release preparation was updated:
- `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0-A-RELEASE-PREP.md`
- commit `349ed55e74b237c77dec64971a7f8dac3ee97c7e`.

ROADMAP current coordination update:
- commit `08b11987b78adee134de77906fd57b2af199e5fb`.

Current FC0-A product work remains PR #340 / V2 IN PROGRESS. This coordination preparation does not activate any downstream lane and does not alter the current CODEX mission.

Bootstrap texts for each lane will be generated on Product Owner request; the bootstrap is only onboarding convenience and GitHub live controls remain authoritative.


## Main decision — two-stage fresh-install partial preview (2026-09-24)

After the four feature DEV lanes are integrated/T2-verified and FND-05/FND-07 are independently VERIFIED/FROZEN, Main will run a partial first-project product audit before later EEE/complete-product acceptance.

Prepared control:
- branch: `coord/w15-fresh-install-preview-control`
- file: `docs/WAVE15-FIRST-PROJECT-FRESH-INSTALL-PREVIEW-CONTROL.md`
- prepared commit: `8d209c8f0cacf5c1feb050632645c9537e1f09dc`

Prepared gates:
- `W15-FIRST-PROJECT-CODEX-BLACKBOX-PREVIEW-01`
- `W15-FIRST-PROJECT-HUMAN-PREVIEW-01`

The two first-project journeys are independent.

CODEX moment:
- fresh installation / no project / no EEE / no hidden Demo project;
- user-like browser exploration;
- high-level objective only: create a first SCADA application from zero and reach a functional truthful Runtime;
- no source/control/database/internal API lookup during the black-box journey;
- no code correction during exploration;
- source/log/API diagnosis is allowed only after the journey completes or is blocked;
- detailed CODEX findings are persisted but not surfaced to Product Owner before the human preview.

Human moment:
- second independent clean environment;
- Product Owner repeats the same high-level first-project mission as a real user;
- no CODEX-created project;
- no detailed CODEX report/checklist before the unaided human journey completes;
- needing help or becoming blocked is itself audit evidence.

After both journeys:
- Main unseals and compares findings as BOTH / CODEX_ONLY / HUMAN_ONLY / PATH_DIVERGENCE / NOT_REPRODUCED;
- a directed follow-up may then cover restart/persistence, Authority/ViewOnly, FND-07 detach -> neutral bootstrap -> Project B -> B/A switching, and a separate HA user-surface/manual transfer check;
- material blockers are corrected/owned; non-blocking onboarding/usability gaps may feed later Installation UX/product convergence.

T1/T2/T3/T4 green evidence does not replace these audits.

Possible partial-preview dispositions:
- `ACCEPTABLE_FOR_NEXT_CONVERGENCE`
- `CHANGES_REQUIRED`

Neither is final Wave 15 acceptance. EEE v15, later T3/T4 and final fresh complete-product Preview remain mandatory.

Roadmap update: `57729b9db0ebcac2c748a9f6f0101eb48c5b625b`.
Six-lane control link update: `e130b5353c320e9c22f8e1f8f3a7e42a2dd6946c`.

This preparation does not activate the preview now and does not alter current PR #340 / CODEX V2 execution.

Accepted V2 closures remain preserved. Two bounded groups remain before merge:
1. actual user-facing Runtime Session Class request/status surface for ViewOnly/Interactive requested-vs-granted/reason truth without FND-03 redesign;
2. missing R6 mounted evidence for shell no-overflow, Engineering independent scroll, compact Engineering Lock lifecycle and known-legacy advanced-authoring/unknown containment.

## Main review — PR #340 V3 product accepted / final evidence-only closeout active (2026-09-24)

Exact V3:

- tree `da022f95a0c2342188a34ffe6dc830acf84d873a`
- natural T1 `36036316797`: SUCCESS.

Main accepts the V3 Runtime Session Class product surface and shell compact-width product direction.

Merge remains blocked only on final test/evidence closure:
- explicit Engineering scroll-composition proof;
- compact Engineering Lock lifecycle proof including lock-now + clear;
- known-legacy advanced-authoring + arbitrary-unknown containment proof;
- focused execution of owner specs that natural T1 did not select.

The T1 Chromium job on V3 executed 16 tests but did not select the Runtime Session mounted spec, app-shell, Engineering Lock or legacy owner-model specs, so its green result is not used as proof for those rows.

## Main review — PR #340 V4 tests accepted / final execution proof active (2026-09-24)

Exact V4 head `87eafb68e4fea7815a26ccffeb8a070fae6564c8` is test-only and natural T1 `36037962003` is green.

Main accepts the added scroll/Lock/legacy tests directionally, but the T1 Chromium log did not execute those owner specs. It selected only python-runtime-host, runtime, script-engineering-workspace-contract, visual-editor-workspace and local-auth bootstrap.

Merge therefore remains blocked solely on execution proof.

Required work is validation-only:
- support multiple profile-owned E2E specs in Wave 15 router;
- make UI_EDITOR execute app-shell, Engineering Lock and visual-editor owner specs in addition to workspace;
- make RUNTIME_RENDERER execute runtime-session owner spec in addition to runtime;
- unit-test router mapping;
- strengthen Lock backend-state transition and arbitrary-unknown containment assertions;
- final exact-head natural T1 must visibly execute these owner specs.

Final audit:
`FC0-A FOUNDATION AUDIT -> MAIN COORDINATOR — ACCEPTABLE / FC0A_RELEASE_APPROVED`
rev 0014.

All six implementation branches were created directly from the exact product release SHA and independently revalidated as identical before coding:
- `work/w15-dev-editor-single-canvas`
- `work/w15-dev-script-engineering`
- `work/w15-dev-authority-ux`
- `work/w15-dev-licensing-ux`

- `work/w15-fnd-07-detach-neutral`

All six lanes are now `ACTIVE_CODING / AUTHORIZED`.

Product release SHA remains `e3ed5138...` even if `wave15/corrections-integration` advances afterward through coordination-only documentation commits.

Ledger: Issue #305 comment `5822605281`.

After all four feature lanes reach integrated T2 verification and FND-05/FND-07 are independently VERIFIED/FROZEN, proceed to the already-defined two-moment fresh-install first-project partial preview: CODEX black-box first, then Product Owner human journey on a separate reset environment.
