# LAST CHANGE — EliteSCADA

**Date:** 2026-09-23 BRT  
**Operational state:** **WAVE 15 ACTIVE / FND-04 VERIFIED+FROZEN / FND-06 ACTIVE / FC0-A BLOCKED ONLY ON FND-06**

## Latest verified product checkpoint

Exact frozen Foundation product checkpoint:

`6c810647c9773a19b212d9c33694780141786ac7`

tree:

`1221ff55963052be4e924dd644efbaa65763f546`

This checkpoint includes FND-03, INFRA-CI-01A and FND-04. Exact FND-04 post-merge EliteSCADA CI #1562 / run `35913456486` completed SUCCESS:
- Web `107358858133` — SUCCESS;
- Backend build/test/smoke `107358858405` — SUCCESS;
- Chromium E2E `107359503423` — SUCCESS.

FND-04 is **VERIFIED/FROZEN**. Its downstream Script TAG reference contract may be consumed but not redefined.

## Current active work

FND-06 is the only active FC0-A blocker.

- order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`
- exact product base: `6c810647c9773a19b212d9c33694780141786ac7`
- work branch: `work/w15-fnd-06-visual-stability-foundation`
- dedicated control: `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FND06-CONTROL.md`
- active control commit: `35e1ae631b8471a66eb0c4042295d5b5628d61ec`
- work branch remains untouched at the exact base and no candidate/PR exists yet.

The frozen FND-06 plan covers centralized known-legacy visual compatibility, Screen/Popup selection stability, canonical renderer/public-model authority, Runtime navigation persistence and Working-vs-Active separation. Full single-canvas WYSIWYG remains downstream DEV-EDITOR scope.

## FC0-A preparation

FC0-A remains **BLOCKED only on FND-06 VERIFIED/FROZEN**.

Prepared downstream release file:
`coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0-A-RELEASE-PREP.md`

Latest prep commit:
`dfae2377f0c6802da726650697040181c7b0f453`

Reserved, not-yet-active orders:
- `DEV-EDITOR-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-AUTHORITY-UX-FC0A-01`
- `DEV-LICENSING-UX-FC0A-01`

No downstream product branch is created before Main records the final exact FC0-A SHA/tree.

## Later Foundation preparation

Read-only/source-audit preparation was completed without product mutation:

- FND-05 HA authority control:
  - branch `coord/w15-fnd05-control`
  - file `docs/WAVE15-FND05-CONTROL.md`
  - prep commit `66d0f0e53a9842c719cfe28ef40da3b7fbdd1f6f`
  - state `PREPARED / NOT ACTIVE`
- FND-07 installation detach control:
  - branch `coord/w15-fnd07-control`
  - file `docs/WAVE15-FND07-CONTROL.md`
  - prep commit `760e1cb57a1bdb1e146a6326bd55f713c7790add`
  - state `PREPARED / NOT ACTIVE`

Neither later Foundation is authorized to mutate product while FND-06 owns the sequential high-risk Foundation executor.

## Foundation current Main gate

- FND-04: **VERIFIED/FROZEN**

- FC0-A: **BLOCKED only on FND-06**
- downstream release package is prepared but not released at `docs/WAVE15-FC0-A-RELEASE-PREP.md` on the FND-06 control branch.



## FND-06 execution metadata correction

Before first product mutation, Main corrected the prepared FND-06 validation profile to the actual Wave 15 router vocabulary: `UI_EDITOR, RUNTIME_RENDERER`. The exact product seed also proves bare `status` is a persisted legacy identifier alongside `tank`, `value` and `dynamo`; it is not a current canonical `core.*` built-in and no guessed alias is authorized.

Active FND-06 order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`.
Control commit: `35e1ae631b8471a66eb0c4042295d5b5628d61ec`.


## FC0-A collision guard

The prepared downstream release package now includes a Main-owned parallel-file collision map. Primary ownership is separated across Editor (`engineering/visual-editor/**`), Script Engineering (`engineering/scripts/**` + `python-editor/**`), Authority UX (`UserAdministration*`) and Licensing UX (`web/licensing/**` + `Scada.LicenseGenerator/**`). Shared shell/router/types/i18n/CI files are Main-coordinated hotspots, not free-for-all lane ownership.

Latest FC0-A prep commit: `dfae2377f0c6802da726650697040181c7b0f453`.


## Coordinator correction — shared CODEX routing and FC0-A audit

A stale FND-04 CODEX `WAIT` order could cause the reused sequential CODEX chat to stop even though FND-06 was active.

Main corrected this at the source:
- FND-04 control rev 0016: `ROUTE-SEQUENTIAL-CODEX-TO-FND06-12`
- commit: `cf19a9b0ce7efbf25d3d85acc2076a8c48148a9d`
- same sequential CODEX chat/lane is explicitly the FND-06 executor
- FND-06 control rev 0004: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`
- commit: `1a1488388fd67bf89380879b07437e1460170f18`

FC0-A sequencing was also tightened:
- FND-06 freeze no longer releases FC0-A directly;
- mandatory gate: `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`;
- audit control created at `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-POST-FND06-AUDIT-CONTROL.md`, commit `0689a53b6cdcb569dd6c65a8326009dfcf2da9de`;
- FC0-A release prep updated at `fee82e7dd8eed8cd237e067317fedbe48d64cb97`;
- FND-05 control rev 0002 / `b995435594f9031a33df5674a0207016405a41d7`;
- FND-07 control rev 0002 / `503a89d2985db64c1d6666e40d1de06251027687`.

After FND-06, audit must relate Wave 15 implementation to final Wave 14 diagnostics, product premises/gaps and frozen contracts. It must also prove FND-05/FND-07 are non-breaking to FC0-A DEV-consumed contracts.

Only audit PASS releases the four FC0-A DEVs and permits FND-05/FND-07 to activate in parallel.


## FND-06 Main review — mounted legacy closeout

Current PR #337 candidate:
- head `923543705378016090e7067b35954795a9591a57`
- tree `5657cee7169a4e77370d416add4efcf07184d7c0`
- natural T1 `35931139983` — SUCCESS
- 9 changed files, all inside FND-06 allowlist
- architecture/scope accepted by Main.

Remaining gate before merge:
- original Wave 14 A7 was a mounted Screen/Popup selection crash that blanked/poisoned Engineering;
- candidate currently proves model/helper compatibility but lacks the required mounted Screen + Popup persisted-legacy selection regression;
- active order: `FND06-CODEX-WAIT-POSTMERGE-V4`;
- control revision `0005`;
- control commit `8d1f415bc16b556e8133e6a1da1ab89881e7f189`;
- preferred delta: tests only; minimal production fix only if the mounted scenario exposes a remaining defect.

The same sequential CODEX lane remains the executor. No merge/freeze yet.


## PR #337 contract-risk snapshot for post-FND06 FC0-A gate

Post-FND06 audit control:
- audit: `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`
- audit rev: `0002`
- latest audit-control commit: `9e75fd836d03dc34619f72ba5056e3aa874cfdbb`

PR #337 pre-freeze evidence:
- candidate `923543705378016090e7067b35954795a9591a57`
- tree `5657cee7169a4e77370d416add4efcf07184d7c0`
- natural T1 `35931139983` SUCCESS
- no Security/Authority/Licensing/Script/lifecycle contract change in its 9-file visual/editor/runtime delta
- FND-06 still HOLD pending mounted A7 closeout; this is an evidence gate, not a known contract break.

Current FC0-A contract-risk classification:
- DEV-EDITOR: `LOW / GUARDED` — must consume frozen FND-06 compatibility/renderer authority; mounted A7 proof still pending.
- DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING: `NONE IDENTIFIED / GUARDED` — FND-04 remains untouched; FND-05 may only fence execution authority around it.
- DEV-AUTHORITY-UX: `NONE IDENTIFIED / GUARDED` — FND-07 must compose FND-02/AUTH-04, not redefine it.
- DEV-LICENSING-UX: `LOW BUT MATERIAL RESIDUAL` — FND-05 redundancy entitlement/readiness must remain additive/backward-compatible to frozen FND-03 semantics.

FND-05 hard guard:
- control rev `0003`
- commit `85502eaaa3a27fc2c050396b3f40c3e08943ae37`
- existing FND-03 license validity/meaning, Interactive/ViewOnly/session quota semantics, machine binding and install/replace/remove behavior may not be reinterpreted by HA.
- if HA needs such a breaking change -> `BLOCKED-CONTRACT` before FC0-A DEV release.

FC0-A release prep snapshot commit:
`c0e4bd69c89c47efc7dc936a6ac9e61cbbbd8f96`.

This is pre-freeze risk assessment only; final release still requires exact FND-06 freeze + independent post-FND06 audit PASS.

## Post-FND06 broad CI exposed generic PostgreSQL blocker

PR #337 merged at `624f2eca456310a2c6156538b3616a06e3be075f`.

Exact broad EliteSCADA CI #1563 / `35940661531`:
- Web — SUCCESS;
- Backend build/test/smoke — FAILURE in test;
- Chromium — skipped downstream.

Only identified failure:
`PostgreSqlVisualDynamicPersistenceTests.RevisionPersistence_PreservesVisualExpressionConditionAndAnalogFill`

Error:
`23505: duplicate key value violates unique constraint pg_namespace_nspname_index`
during `PostgreSqlEngineeringProjectStore.InitializeAsync`.

The store and failing test are byte-identical to the pre-FND06 checkpoint. PR #337 did not touch Persistence/PostgreSQL. Same PostgreSQL catalog-race signature was diagnosed in Wave 14.

Main did not rerun blindly.

Active generic correction:
- `INFRA-CI-01B-POSTGRES-SCHEMA-LOCK-V1`
- control `coord/w15-infra-ci-01b-control:docs/WAVE15-INFRA-CI-01B-CONTROL.md`
- control commit `358b067d9af6501b2945f311b5d2cd32cab64efa`
- exact base `624f2eca456310a2c6156538b3616a06e3be075f`
- work branch `work/w15-infra-ci-01b-postgresql-schema-init`.

FND-06 = INTEGRATED / MAIN-ACCEPTED / FREEZE BLOCKED BY GENERIC INFRA.
FC0-A audit remains PREPARED.


## Broad CI #1564 — PostgreSQL fixed; FND-06 E2E fixture leak remains

Exact run `35944510920` on `eb4563cf0060449b479c4335ef30a19ed65e35ab`:
- Web SUCCESS;
- Backend build/test/smoke SUCCESS;
- Chromium FAILURE: 636 passed / 1 failed.

The PostgreSQL failure that triggered INFRA-CI-01B is closed at the backend gate.

The sole Chromium failure is `runtime.spec.ts`, which saw an extra `fnd06-legacy-screen-*` created by the FND-06 mounted closeout test.

Root cause: JSON import/apply for Screens/Popups is upsert-only. Reapplying the pre-test export cannot delete a new fixture entity.

Active test-only correction:
- `FND06-CODEX-E2E-FIXTURE-ISOLATION-V6`
- work `work/w15-fnd06-e2e-fixture-isolation`
- FND-06 control rev 0010 / `b7b3ab914464a2da87d7b2175eb95a24d8a7db9b`.

No product semantic change is authorized.


## Pre-audit finding — W15-P1-01 Server Script recovery

While preparing the mandatory post-FND06 FC0-A audit, Main revalidated the current Server Script runtime against the final Wave 14 backlog contract.

Current source still shows:
- `ScriptRuntimeExecutionCoordinator.ProcessNextAsync` returns `Throttled` while diagnostics `IsThrottled` is true;
- the only coordinator exit is explicit `ResetThrottle()`;
- repository search found no production automatic Server Script caller of `ResetThrottle()`;
- existing tests prove timeout -> throttled behavior, not bounded cooldown/half-open/probe recovery.

Wave 14/W15-P1-01 explicitly required bounded automatic recovery and rejected a permanent silent throttle latch.

Preliminary disposition:
`W15-P1-01 = PRELIMINARY BLOCKED_FOUNDATION`

This finding is independent of FND-06 and does not prevent FND-06 from becoming VERIFIED/FROZEN if exact broad CI #1565 is green. It **does** prevent immediate FC0-A release if the independent audit confirms it.

Audit evidence:
- `coord/w15-fnd06-control:docs/WAVE15-FC0A-POST-FND06-AUDIT-EVIDENCE.md`
- preliminary matrix commit `3483faf3aab4940791807b07b4453865629d9077`
- audit control rev 0008 / commit `18a0fcda2b354779cdf0f1ba4d829a838714b3d2`.

DEV-SCRIPT-ENGINEERING may not absorb this runtime/Foundation correction silently.


## Independent AUD routing prepared

The former FND-04 independent AUD lane is now pre-routed, but not activated, for the mandatory post-FND06 closure audit.

- current AUD order: `FC0A-AUD-WAIT-FND06-FINAL-BROAD-0012`
- state: `WAIT_FND06_FINAL_BROAD`
- final broad: `35953557122`
- provisional exact product checkpoint: `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`
- FND-04 AUD control rev 0023 / `1be8ef8cbdd555f3fa554e905faafab186c21dd3`
- next audit: `FC0A-POST-FND06-W15-FOUNDATION-AUDIT-01`

AUD must independently confirm/disprove Main's preliminary P1-01 Server Script recovery blocker after activation.


## Pre-audit finding — W15-P1-06 truthful Engineering fallback

Exact source inspected at the final FND-06 product checkpoint `560ac9d80cc7e854f2513559dc6afb28cfb4aee3`:

`web/scada-web/src/engineering/EngineeringApp.tsx`

Observed:
- `snapshot` initializes as null while loading;
- failed load sets/keeps `snapshot=null` and renders an error/retry state;
- the sidebar project chip nevertheless renders `snapshot?.workspace.projectName ?? snapshot?.workspace.projectKey ?? 'Demo Project'`;
- therefore an absent/unloaded public model can still be displayed as `Demo Project`;
- no-model WorkspaceBar fallbacks can also present `unsaved` / `clean` despite no authoritative Working model.

This matches the Wave14 A6 / W15-P1-06 class that required truthful loading/unavailable/error identity rather than a fictitious Working project.

Preliminary disposition:
`W15-P1-06 = PRELIMINARY BLOCKED_PRODUCT / SHARED_ENGINEERING_SHELL`

This is not causal to FND-06 and does not block its freeze if broad #1565 is green. If independent audit confirms it, FC0-A remains blocked until a bounded shared-shell correction is integrated/revalidated.

Audit control rev 0009:
`888473cbf27e003d659ec3dd87de2f0f89240474`
